  - "Mrr\u2026 Something bad\u2019s brewing, dearie. Come here and listen to an old
    woman ramble a bit. "
  - 'A long time ago, there was a monster who hated the world and all the people
    in it. It drove them mad, turned them to monsters. '
  - 'But most of all, it hated the sun. Its light burned its skin and kept it at
    bay, lurking in the shadows.  '
  - 'But the monster only grew stronger with each unfortunate victim it claimed.
    One day it became powerful enough to plunge the world into an eternal night. '
  - 'That is, until it got sealed away. Oh yes, behind the Great Door, sealed by
    the magic of the two Sun Pillars.  '
  - " Hah! I can see impatience on your face. You\u2019ve heard that story a dozen
    times growing up, haven\u2019t you? About the heroes who caged it up so long
    ago? "
  - "Then you know how important it is you get those pillars working again. I don\u2019t
    know what\u2019s happened, but it\u2019s up to you to investigate. These old
    bones aren\u2019t what they used to be.\r\n"
  - "You don\u2019t have much time, dearie. Once the sun sets, that beastie\u2019s
    gonna break loose. And who knows what\u2019ll happen after that."
  - ' Here, take this. I used to use it to keep unpleasant visitors away from my
    farm. Go try it out on something, see how it suits you.'
