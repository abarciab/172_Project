    we can fix everything after all\u2026"
  - "Oh, geez. The Sun Pillar. Right, right\u2026 I\u2019ll get right on that."
  - " Uh\u2026 Another problem. Not to add to your list of problems, but\u2026 I\u2019m

  - " I\u2019ll stand by here. Once you go and shut those doors completely I\u2019ll
    reactivate the Sun Pillar."
  - "Uh, no pressure! I\u2019m sure you can do it\u2026"
